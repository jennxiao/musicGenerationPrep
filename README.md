# Music Generation
_A project for Berkeley student-org, Codeology._

**Developed by Alma Pineda and Jennifer Xiao**

### Inspiration

Who doesn't like music? Jennifer and I are certainly huge fans. Taking our love for music and our knowledge of ML, we came up with this idea for a four week music generation project in which (using Google Magenta's RNN models) you will be able to train a model to generate some music for you! 

This project is not only extremely customizable and fun, but we have included materials with which to familiarize yourself with ML concepts in general.

### Requirements

Althought this topic and project may seem intimidating due to it being an application of ML, this four week project was designed to be attempted and worked through by students of basic programming level.

You will need only the notebook found under our hw directory and access to a MIDI file of your song of choosing!


### Structure
**Week One**
* Introductions and Team Building
* Intro to ML (Part I) - What really is ML and how can it be applied to different problems?
* Environment Set-Up: familiarizing yourself with Colab and Google Magenta
*HW: Continue setting up environment; HW 1 assignment (see hw directory)*

**Week Two**
* Review from Week I, any questions?
* Intro to ML (Part II) - Linear Regression, Supervised vs Unsupervised
* Collaboration time to work through in-workshop notebook
*HW: Generate NoteSequences from selected MIDI file*

**Week Three**
* Review ideas about loss functions, gradient descent, back propagation  
* Diving into high level ideas about deep learning, neural nets, LSTM
*HW: Train model using Magenta RNN*

**Week Four**
* Review on LSTM, RNN -- any questions?
* Generate your melody using your trained model
* Prep for showcase!
