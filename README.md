# Music Generation using LSTM RNN
*ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶Learn ML topics and build ML-generated music!ðŸŽµðŸŽ¶*

**Goal:** 

This project was designed to be taught and implemented over the course of four weeks using very friendly technologies such as Jupyter notebooks and the Magenta library (developed by Google). The project is intended to introduce users to basic ML topics and reinforce said topics via an application of a recurrent neural network (RNN) using long short term memory (LSTM) that generates music based on MIDI files. This project is highly customizable and a more complete walkthrough can be found on the Magenta repository [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/melody_rnn).

This repo contains teaching materials for introductory ML topics and some assignments designed to reinforce material. Weekly slides include steps necessary to implement the actual music generation project.

**Week 1** - What is Machine Learning? Basic steps in solving problems with ML. 

**Week 2** - Linear Regression, Regression vs Classifications

**Week 3** - Neural Nets, Perceptrons, LSTM

**Week 4** - Review and Prep for a Showcase

Hi there! I am a fourth-year student at UC Berkeley studying Data Science and Applied Mathematics. The inspiration for this notebook came from our mututal love for music and the interest in ML applications that were more creative.
